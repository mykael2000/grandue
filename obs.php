                <p class="mb-5">
                    Online banking fraud is the intentional illegal act to obtain
                    money or assets from victims through the coercion of personal
                    information through various different methods. Online banking
                    scams didn’t really take off until circa 2004, even though
                    internet banking has been around since 1981. Internet banking
                    became widely used in the late nineties and early noughties. This
                    increase in online banking use naturally gives way to many
                    opportunities for internet banking scammers. For instance, satista
                    reports since 2017, internet banking use has grown from 30% in
                    Great Britain to 76% in 2022. It’s becoming more difficult for
                    individuals to protect themselves appropriately as scammers become
                    more skilled at crafting campaigns
                </p>

                    How does online banking fraud happen?
                </h1>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The popularity of online banking is generally due to its
                    convenience for both user and the bank as it is more efficient for
                    both parties. Online banking also cuts out the need to personally
                    visit the bank to make transfers or payments.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Benefits aside, internet banking comes the inherent risk of types
                    of internet banking scams. As users weren’t initially aware of the
                    risks of online banking and weren’t protecting themselves
                    accordingly, scammers have taken advantage of the opportunities to
                    target unsuspecting victims. This is why many people have fallen
                    victim to online banking fraud over the years, leading to a steady
                    incline of online banking scams.

                    the financial Times correlating a surge in mobile banking to the
                    doubling of online bankers in the last decade. This trend answers
                    for the increased opportunities for internet banking scams, which
                    is why online banking scams are so common today. Common types of
                    internet banking fraud are no longer limited to computers but also
                    include types of mobile banking frauds too, with 45% of the

                        any personal information entered into banking sites.

                    These scammers are talented in making sure that the email looks
                    legitimate from your bank, with a staggering 97% of people unable
                    to identify a sophisticated phishing email. Your bank will never
                    ask you to share personal log in or banking details via email. If
                    you receive an email from your bank or an unknown email address
                    impersonating your bank asking you to update or share your bank
