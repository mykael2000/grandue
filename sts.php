                <p class="mb-2">
                    are a form of centralized exchange where investors buy and sell
                    ownership (stocks) of various companies. Most stock markets
                    worldwide are highly regulated and involve legal, nationally
                    registered, and regulated brokers to facilitate the transfer of
                    stock from a seller to a buyer. Examples of regulated stock
                    exchanges are the US-based NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) and the
                    NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
                    Quotations). Our ability to access the stock market has never been
                    more effortless, and the barriers to entry continue to fall every
                    year.

                <p class="mb-5">
                    But this ease of access is not without its dangers. We are all
                    susceptible to different types of investment scams in the
                    investment and stock world, so it is incumbent on us to do our due
                    diligence and protect ourselves and our money from becoming

                <p class="mb-2">
                    One of the biggest questions and, for many, beliefs about the
                    stock market is that it is rigged. Is it? The US’s stock markets
                    are regulated by various government and non-government entities
                    such as the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and FINRA
                    (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). Both the SEC and FINRA
                    have overlapping legal responsibilities that monitor the stock
                    exchanges and the various brokers that facilitate the buying and
                    selling of stocks. However, that doesn’t mean we can avoid all
                    fraud and scams.

                    Current and past companies intentionally deceive individual
                    investors and/or participate in illegal accounting and business
                    practices, such as ENRON and Valant Pharmaceuticals. Some
                    fraudulent individuals create ‘too good to be true’ advertisements
                    that result in Ponzi schemes – the worst actor in history being
                    Bernie Madoff.

                    You even have regulated online stock brokers that do not practice

                    most recent example would be Robin hood during the early 2022
                    GameStop debacle. While there are obvious risks in the stock

                <h3 class="display-6 mb-2">Ponzi Schemes</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Perhaps the most well-known version of a stock fraud scheme in
                    history is a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme involves paying
                    investment profits to old investors with the deposits of new
                    investors. When a new investor joins the system, it is most often
                    at the advice of another investor unknowingly part of the Ponzi
                    scheme. What makes Ponzi schemes so successful is the perceived
                    legitimacy and history of returns. Ponzi schemes can exist for
                    years or even decades.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    In the case of Bernie Madoff, his Ponzi scheme and fraud empire
                    lasted for over 20 years. He was so successful at this fraud that
                    his firm even became one of the leading market makers of the stock
                    market, and he was a former chairman of the NASDAQ! Ponzi schemes
                    eventually fail because there is never enough new investor money
                    to keep paying off old investors. Some of the keywords or phrases
                    with a Ponzi scheme are ‘guaranteed income,’ ‘offshore
                    investment,’ ‘small, private hedge fund,’ ‘secret invite-only
                    fund,’ or any other form of ‘too good to be true’ sales pitch.
                </p>
                <h3 class="display-6 mb-2">Pump and Dump</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Pump and Dump (sometimes referred to as P&Ds) scams are perhaps
                    one of the classic and persistent forms of stock fraud that exist.
                    What makes challenging to detect is that they can often be done in
                    a legitimate fashion. A pump and dump is essentially an event
                    where you are targeted to buy a stock. The stock is sometimes
                    referred to as a ‘multi-bagger,’ indicating a massive return on
                    investment. You may also read about how the stock is an emerging
                    leader in its sector/industry, how it could be the next Apple or
                    Amazon.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The stocks used in pump and dump are often publicly traded and
                    listed on a regulated exchange like the NASDAQ and bought through
                    a regulated stockbroker. The stock price is almost always between
                    $1.00 to $10.00; how a pump and dump works is straightforward. The
                    scammers purchase the cheap stock early then begins to campaign on
                    its behalf and drum up support and enthusiasm. As new investors
                    buy, the price starts to spike up and accelerate – it is at that
                    point the originators of the scam sell and exit their positions at
                    a significant profit and at the expense of yourself and everyone
                    else who bought too late.
                </p>
                <h3 class="display-6 mb-2">Penny Stock Scams</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Along with pump and dump scams, penny stock scams are among the
                    oldest and most well-known forms of stock fraud. Penny scams and
                    pump and dumps often work hand in hand with pump and dump scams
                    utilizing penny stocks. Penny stock scams are often touted as ways
                    to invest in new companies via their stock at very low-priced
                    shares with the promise of massive returns in the future – the
                    definition of a get rich quick scheme. The phrase ‘Penny Stock’
                    doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock is worth pennies – today,
                    it generally means a very low-value stock.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    However, modern penny stock scams have increasingly used stocks
                    that are not available from the major regulated exchanges like the
                    NYSE. Instead, these penny stocks are found on the ‘Pink Sheets’
                    or OTC markets (Over The Counter). OTC securities are not always
                    available from regulated stockbrokers as the securities themselves
                    must be exchanged between the company selling their stock to you
                    directly or through another non-centralized broker/exchange.

                <h3 class="display-6 mb-2">Stock Broker Fraud</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Stock Broker Fraud Stock broker fraud is, thankfully, one of the
                    forms of fraud that has decreased as stock markets have become
                    more regulated. However, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. The
                    days of a stockbroker taking the old physical paper securities or
                    deposited cash and running away are long gone. Stockbrokers who
                    wish to do wrong by the clients today now have to resort to more
                    shady methods. One of the most prevalent (and, sometimes legal)
                    forms of stockbroker fraud is an activity known as
                    ‘front-running.’ Let’s say you were to call your brokerage firm
                    and you wanted to buy 100 shares of XYZ. Your broker, knowing that
                    this would likely move the market, instead places an order himself
                    before executing your order. The broker essentially enters the
                    market early, for himself, before completing your order and allows
                    your order to drive up the value of his earlier entry.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The major problem with front-running is it is nearly impossible to
                    detect. With the amount of high-frequency-trading (HFT) that
                    occurs every second, front-running is a type of fraud that only
                    diligent and active regulators can determine. There are other
                    tactics that stockbrokers will employ that are not necessarily
                    fraudulent but unethical. Some types of behavior are encouraging
                    high-frequency day trading by new investors, undisclosed
                    appropriation of dividends, and unclear rules or fees associated
                    with shorting.

                <p class="mb-5">
                    If you have seen the movie ‘The Wolf of Wall street’ then you have
                    seen what a boiler room is. Jordan Belfort’s (Wolf of Wall street)
                    company employed hundreds of ‘brokers’ who called prospective
                    investors to buy stock in individual companies – often overvalued
                    but cheap companies. The ‘broker’ used high energy sale tactics
                    that made the potential investor fear they would be missing out on
                    an opportunity of a lifetime (FOMO = Fear Of Missing Out). While
                    the days of call-center type boiler rooms like those in The Wolf
                    of Wall Street no longer exist, that doesn’t mean the concept has
                    gone away. It has evolved. Instead of boiler rooms, we now have
                    subreddits (the website Reddit), private/public forums and message
                    boards, emails, text alerts, fraudulent websites, fake webinars,
                    automated social media generators on Twitter, Facebook, and
                    StockTwits (Twitter version for stock traders). Modern boiler room
                    operations are now more prevalent than their old counterparts, and
                    they continue to grow and become more sophisticated.

                <h3 class="display-6 mb-2">Signal Providers</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Signal providers are companies or individuals which want you to
                    subscribe to their frequent notifications which will give you a
                    stock to buy or short, what the stock price entry is, where to
                    take profit and where to place a stop loss or trailing stop. While
                    this kind of service sounds fantastic and appears like a good
                    deal, signal providers are only after one thing: your
                    subscription, and is another one of the potential stock scams.
                    Almost all signal providers are just nicer versions of scammers
                    and fraudsters who are able to operate and peddle their service in
                    a legal way. You may also come across signal providers who offer
                    their services for free. Signal providers who provide a free
                    service are almost always involved in Pump and Dump schemes. They
                    entice new traders and investors into thinking that they’re
                    getting a great deal by getting free information – when all you
                    are really doing is acting as a liquidity tool to pump up a stock
                    that the provider has every intention of dumping as soon as its
                    price spikes higher.
