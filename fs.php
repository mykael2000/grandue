                    The Forex industry is one of the scammer’s favorite grounds. Since
                    the industry is generally known as a legitimate investment option,
                    it is very hard for the average person to differentiate the scam
                    brokers, from the legitimate ones. Usually, most people don’t even
                    know they’ve been scammed, they just think they had “A bad trading
                    day”. If you feel that the way you lost your money trading, is

                <h1 class="display-6 mb-5">What is forex trading?</h1>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    is the single largest traded market globally, with up to five
                    trillion traded each day and is considered decentralized because
                    there is no central processor for trades– in other words, there is
                    no entity that acts as a central exchange like the NASDAQ or the
                    NYSE. Instead, orders are completed by millions of traders using
                    millions of various forex brokers around the world.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    Foreign currency trading is one of the most leveraged markets in
                    the world as well. In the US, regulations limit a person to 50:1
                    leverage. In other countries, they have zero limits on leverage.
                    It is not uncommon to see some non-US brokers offer 1000+:1. Due
                    to these factors and a few others which we will discuss, this is
                    why scams can be so prevalent within the foreign exchange market.

                    If a broker advertises a bonus on deposits, make sure that you can
                    withdraw the bonus within a reasonable amount of time – it should
                    be clear what the requirements are for you to withdraw the bonus.

                    Recovering funds in the forex trading market is difficult. The

                    the problem is the near impossibility of recompense from the
                    scammers who defrauded you.
