                    Cryptocurrency Scams – How These Works & How To Avoid Them Fake
                    ICOs Scammers At this moment in time, the simplest form of crypto
                    scam is called the Fake ICOs. Through this scamming technique,
                    scammers can easily deceive new investors by showing fake sale
                    tokens and stock exchange information.
                </p>
                <h1 class="display-6 mb-5">How It Works</h1>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    The new user becomes a part of the messenger group. The user gets
                    fake messages from a fake administrator. Fake offers include
                    lucrative private bonuses. The scammers convince the interested
                    personnel to transfer ETH to a ‘Special Address’. Once the fund
                    transfer is done, the scammers get disappeared.

                    Make in-depth analysis. Check the White paper carefully. Try to
                    find a legal roadmap of the token info. Discuss with friends
                    before transferring the funds.
                </p>

                <h1 class="display-6 mb-5">Cloned Fishing Websites</h1>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Scammers create cloned fishing websites to steal confidential
                    information of the investors using this scamming method.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    <strong>How It Works</strong>
                    Depending on your conversation with the scammers, they send out a
                    link to you (usually the link of a fake site that looks like an
                    original cryptocurrency site). They will place lucrative offers on
                    their fake website. When you click on their link and sign up, your
                    credentials go directly to the database of the scammers.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    <strong>How To Avoid</strong>
                    Never click on any unknown or unrecognized links. Before visiting
                    a site, check the URL of the site at the address of your browser.
                    Always pay attention to the special characters in the URL link.
                    Fake Support Team Another common form of phishing technique is to
                    create a fake support team in order to get your personal
                    information like deposit amounts and passwords.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    <strong>How It Works</strong>
                    The user may face a problem while doing an exchange using Bitbns,
                    Binance, Coinde lta, and others. The scammers use the same name
                    and image as the administrator of the support team in order to
                    create a fake identity. The new users may get confused and trust
                    the fraudster. Scammers then may ask for ETH or BTC. Users usually
                    send the amount so that their problem gets a solution. Scammers
                    become disappeared after getting the fund.

                    Do not exchange with unknown sources. Whenever you face a problem,
                    try to discuss it with your friends first. Double-check the
                    information of the administrator before sending any funds. It
                    would be best to make an in-depth analysis before transferring any
                    fund. Fake Exchanges & Apps Always keep in mind that the crypto
                    world is full of shadow exchanges that can disappear within a
                    matter of time. And, most of these exchanges are taken place by
                    using varieties of fake apps.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    <strong>How It Works </strong>
                    Scammers develop fake apps. The fraudsters share fake documents
                    which look like the original ones. Fake exchange offerings deceive
                    you with lucrative returns. Once you make a transaction, the
                    entire exchange history gets deleted.

                    volumes whether there is any unrealistic spike. Study and analyze.

                    equipment, crypto scammers have come up with varied types of cloud
                    mining scams.

                    Before you make any investment, make a thorough check of the
                    platform. Most of the Ponzi schemes usually don’t reveal the
                    information of the owners. Check and verify the legal status of
                    those platforms. Try to analyze the user reviews of the platform.
