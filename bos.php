                <p class="mb-2">
                    Binary options are a type of financial product classified as an
                    exotic option. Binary options trading may seem like a new
                    speculative market, but they’ve existed since 1974. They were
                    created by one of the largest derivatives markets globally, CBOE
                    (Chicago Board Options Exchange). It wasn’t until 2008 that binary
                    options became primarily available to the public, and many
                    entities copied the original CBOE asset type listing.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    Binary options are a type of option that allows you to guess
                    whether the option expires in the money – that’s it. Some
                    unregulated binary options brokers allow for guessing on out of
                    the money outcomes. A simple yes or no bet is made, hence the name
                    binary. Contemporary binary options have expiration times between
                    a week to a few minutes, with the majority of modern binary
                    options platforms specializing in under one-day expirations.

                <h1 class="display-6 mb-5">Are Binary Options a scam or legit?</h1>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Binary options are overwhelmingly a scam and an illegitimate
                    market. When you consider the various legal differences between
                    the US, UK, and EU financial regulations, you may be surprised to
                    find out that binary options markets are legal in the US but are
                    now illegal in the EU and UK. In fact, the bans imposed on binary
                    options markets in the EU and UK are very recent – 2018 for the
                    former and 2019 for the latter.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    A large reason for the banning of binary options in the EU was due
                    to the dubious nature of CySEC (Cyprus Securities and Exchange
                    Commission) broad granting of national regulatory approval to a
                    large number of unethical binary options brokers.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The US’s high regulatory environment makes participation in binary
                    options marginally safer from a compliance standpoint, but it does
                    not remove the inherent too high-risk nature of binary options.
                    There is perhaps no market in the realm of financial markets that
                    professional speculators and investors more deride than the binary
                    options market. Know that binary options are more akin to gambling
                    than speculation and that it is a true zero-sum instrument.

                    <strong>Binary Options robot scams: </strong>If you are a day
                    trader or an aspiring day trader, familiar with some of the
                    largest speculative and high-frequency trading markets in the
                    world like forex or futures, you are probably familiar with the
                    prevalence of robots (commonly known as ‘bots’). Binary options
                    robots are often sold as a way to manage your account. This
                    involves sharing your account information or an API to allow an
                    individual or automated system to execute trades on your behalf.
                    Binary option robot scams include many high-pressure sales
                    tactics, false statements on the return on investment and success
                    rates, along with graphics depicting a wealthy lifestyle as a
                    result of using their system.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Binary Options software scams: </strong>Software scams in
                    the binary options space are common and fall right into the same
                    realm as robots. Depending on the software used for binary options
                    (most are often done via web browser), some software is touted as
                    ‘advanced artificial intelligence (AI)’ or ‘machine learning
                    software,’ leading you to believe that it is an extremely
                    sophisticated algorithm that will generate substantial gains. Many
                    software providers report high returns – the returns the software
                    provider is making is from selling his/her software to others, not
                    on the success of the software in the binary options market. As
                    with robot scams, be wary of the sales tactics and false lifestyle
                    imagery.

                    <strong>Binary Options trading scams: </strong>The number of
                    trading scams in the binary options space is substantial. Because
                    some of the largest regulatory agencies around the world have
                    banned binary options, many former (and new) brokers have had to
                    reestablish their businesses in nations where there is little to
                    no real regulation. The broad bans of binary options have resulted
                    in thousands of unregistered brokers all around the globe. Brokers
                    within the binary options space have questionable to outright
                    fraudulent data feeds. It’s not uncommon to see bids and ask
                    fluctuate violently within the final micro-seconds resulting in
                    significant losses, sometimes on both sides of the trade! You can
                    avoid some of the trading scams by using only regulated brokers,
                    although very few are legitimate.

                    <strong>Binary Options signal scams: </strong>Signal scams are
                    hands down the most prevalent form of financial fraud and scams in
                    today’s markets. For the binary options market, signal scams
                    involve an individual or company that offers to sell you trade
                    ideas (signals) in exchange for a monthly fee. The signals are
                    provided via text, email, or via their website. The most popular
                    version of providing signals in most markets is through the chat
                    platform Telegram. As with any financial instrument, it is best to
                    avoid signal providers – they are only interested in making money
                    from you as a subscriber.

                    Only use regulated brokers – for the US, the regulatory agency(s)
                    for binary options fall under the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading
                    Commission) and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).
                    Legitimate brokers will openly disclose their license number and
                    cite the national regulatory agency and website.

                    Do your due diligence – read user reviews across various sources.
                    Be wary of sites that are specific to reviewing only binary
                    options brokers – they are more than likely just shell sites meant
                    to push you to a particular broker or a few select brokers.

                    If the broker is unregulated, check where the broker is based –
                    it’s good to know what nation the business is headquartered in.

                    If you do want to risk your capital in the binary options markets,
                    test the broker’s data yourself. Vet the broker and ensure that
                    data feeds are authentic and that there are no abnormal price
                    changes near expiry.
